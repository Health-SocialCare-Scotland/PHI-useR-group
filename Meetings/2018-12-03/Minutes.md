# Minutes

1. All materials relating to meetings are to be stored in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/PHI-useR-group), with a separate folder for each meeting.
2. Meetings will be held approximately every three months - normally the month before the R User group meeting. A volunteer is required to be the organiser of the next one.
3. The group needs a name - the current one is a placeholder.
4. Alan presented on Shiny using RPortable, knitting to PDF using RMarkdown, including code snippets within RStudio and some R news. His slides can be found in the [slides](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/PHI-useR-group/tree/master/Meetings/2018-12-03/Slides) sub-folder. The code for the Shiny app can be found in the [code](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/PHI-useR-group/tree/master/Meetings/2018-12-03/Code) sub-folder.
5. Alan will take the RPortable solution for Shiny apps to the January R user group meeting. It was discussed that this may be suitable for internal use, but an improved Shiny server will likely be required to share confidential data externally.
6. Tina presented the RMarkdown publication templates her and Rory have been working on as part of TPP. Alice and Caroline expressed interest in using their teams' publications as test cases.
7. Jaime presented a [Shiny app](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/nhs-r-resources/) containing R resources. The code for this app is available in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/nss-r-resources-app).
8. Jaime will take this app to the January R User group meeting, and add Alan's [guide](https://datasciencescotland.slack.com/files/UAV527E2G/FDW82RTPV/tinytex_offline_installation_guide.pdf) to knitting to PDF using RMarkdown.
9. Alan discussed the possibility of automating the RPortable solution to Shiny apps, but it would take time to set this up.
10. Alan suggested that using code snippets could make it easier to use the templates for [R projects](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/r-project-structure) and [Shiny apps](https://github.com/Health-SocialCare-Scotland/rshiny-project-structure). It wasn't decided if this will be pursued, but instructions on how to set this up will need to be added to the README files for the templates if it is.
